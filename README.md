# fan-fiction [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/fan-fiction.svg)](https://clojars.org/fan-fiction)

Write [Storybook][storybook] in ClojureScript with ease.

__Library is still undergoing development, so expect frequent changes to
the API.__ The current version only supports [Reagent][reagent].

## Quick Start

`fan-fiction` does not include [Reagent][reagent] as its dependency, so
add both as the development dependency to your tool of choice.

`fan-fiction.reagent` contains two macros:

* `foreword`: creates the `default` property that [Storybook][storybook]
  expects.
* `defstory`: well, the story.

```clojure
(ns hello.world
  (:require [fan-fiction.reagent :refer [foreword defstory]]))

(defn greeting [person]   ;; this probably should be in a different namespace
  [:h1 "Hello, " person "!"])

(foreword :title          "Greeting component"
          :component      greeting
          :hide-controls  false)      ;; default is true

(defstory hello-world [greeting "World"])
```

`hide-controls` is an alias of the longer `hideNoControlsWarning` setting.
The equivalent [Component Story Format (CSF)][csf] in JavaScript is as follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Greeting } from './greeting';

export default {
  title: 'Greeting component',
  component: Greeting,
  parameters: {controls: {hideNoControlsWarning: false}}
};

export const HelloWorld = () => <Greeting name='World' />;
```

### Using with Shadow-CLJS

If you are using [Shadow-CLJS][shadow-cljs], note that `fan-fiction` doesn't
work with version 2.12.x (for some unknown reason). As of this writing,
version 2.15.8 works well.

Set `:target` as `:npm-module` in the `shadow-cljs.edn` and list the
stories' namespaces under `:entries`. Refer to
[shadow-cljs.edn](./shadow-cljs.edn) for an example.
